# toddr: Todd's personal R package


This R package contains functions that are useful to Todd (and may be useful to others). However, many of these functions have not been thoroughly tested, so please use at your own risk.


## Install

Installing the package from a GitHub Enterprise (organization) account requires a few extra arguments, including an [authorization token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). The authorization token is set to expire on 2023-09-30. Please let me know if it is expired or you have any other issues installing from GitHub. 


```{r}
remotes::install_github("knut0297org/toddr", host = "github.umn.edu/api/v3", auth_token = "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")
